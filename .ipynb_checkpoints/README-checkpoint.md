# web-scrapping
This project involves scraping book URLs from Amazon and experimenting with BeautifulSoup for web scraping. The collected data is then converted into a DataFrame and exported in Excel format.

Steps:
1. Scraping Book URLs from Amazon: Using BeautifulSoup to extract book URLs and relevant information from Amazon.
2. Data Processing: Converting the scraped data into dictionaries.
3. Data Conversion: Transforming the dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame.
4. Exporting Data: Saving the DataFrame in Excel format for further analysis.

P.s work_space is used to study BeautifulSoup and how it work :)
